## üìã Video Demonstration Plan (5-8 minutes total)

### Section 1: W7 Requirements Overview (1 minute)

**What to Show:**

- **Project Structure**: Display complete file structure in VS Code
- **4 Collections**: Show routes directory with artists.js, albums.js, songs.js, playlists.js
- **7+ Fields Verification**: Open Artists collection showing 9 fields
- **Technology Stack**: Express.js, MongoDB, OAuth, Jest testing, Swagger

**Script:**
"Let's start by verifying all W7 requirements. Our Music API has 4 complete collections as seen in our routes directory. The Artists collection exceeds the 7+ field requirement with 9 fields: name, genre, country, formed_year, members, biography, website, social_media, plus createdAt and updatedAt timestamps. All collections have full CRUD operations with comprehensive validation."

**Fields to Highlight:**

```javascript
Artists (9 fields):
- name, genre, country, formed_year, members
- biography, website, social_media
- createdAt, updatedAt

Albums (8 fields):
- title, artist_id, release_date, genre
- track_count, duration, record_label, cover_image_url

Songs (9 fields):
- title, album_id, artist_id, duration, track_number
- genre, lyrics, audio_url, featured_artists

Playlists (8 fields):
- name, creator_name, description, songs
- tags, is_public, cover_image_url, createdAt
```

### Section 2: Full CRUD Operations Demo (2 minutes)

**What to Show - Complete CRUD Cycle:**

```
1. POST /artists (Create new artist)
2. GET /artists (Read all artists)
3. GET /artists/:id (Read single artist)
4. PUT /artists/:id (Update artist)
5. DELETE /artists/:id (Delete artist)
```

**Demonstration Steps:**

1. **Create**: POST new artist with OAuth authentication
2. **Read**: GET all artists showing the new one in list
3. **Read Single**: GET specific artist by ID
4. **Update**: PUT to modify artist data
5. **Delete**: DELETE to remove artist

**Script:**
"Let me demonstrate full CRUD operations on our Artists collection. First, I'll create a new artist - notice the OAuth authentication requirement... [show POST success]. Now let's read all artists showing our new entry... [show GET]. Here's reading a single artist by ID... [show GET by ID]. Now I'll update the artist... [show PUT]. Finally, let's delete it... [show DELETE success]."

### Section 3: Error Handling & Validation Demo (1.5 minutes)

**What to Show:**

- **Missing Required Fields**: POST without required data
- **Invalid Data Types**: Send wrong data types
- **Relationship Validation**: Invalid artist_id in album creation
- **OAuth Protection**: Unauthorized access attempts
- **Success Scenarios**: Proper validation passing

**Error Examples to Demo:**

```javascript
// Missing required fields
POST /artists
{
  "name": ""  // Empty name - should fail
}

// Invalid data type
POST /artists
{
  "name": "Test Artist",
  "formed_year": "not-a-number"  // Should fail
}

// Invalid relationship
POST /albums
{
  "title": "Test Album",
  "artist_id": "invalid-id"  // Should fail
}

// Unauthorized access
POST /artists (without OAuth) // Should return 401
```

**Script:**
"Error handling and validation are crucial for production APIs. Watch what happens with invalid data... [demo validation errors]. Notice the detailed error messages that help developers. Here's relationship validation - trying to create an album with an invalid artist reference... [show error]. And here's our OAuth security preventing unauthorized access... [show 401 error]."

### Section 4: Unit Testing Coverage (1 minute)

**What to Show:**

- **Run Test Suite**: Execute `npm test` in terminal
- **Test Coverage**: Show 16+ tests passing across all collections
- **Individual Collection Tests**: Highlight test files structure

**Terminal Demo:**

```bash
npm test
# Show results: All tests passing
# 4+ tests per collection √ó 4 collections = 16+ tests
```

**Test Files to Mention:**

```
tests/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ testSetup.js (MongoDB Memory Server)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ artists.test.js (4+ GET endpoint tests)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ albums.test.js (4+ GET endpoint tests)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ songs.test.js (4+ GET endpoint tests)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ playlists.test.js (4+ GET endpoint tests)
```

**Script:**
"Professional APIs require comprehensive testing. Let me run our complete test suite... [run npm test]. You can see all 16+ tests passing, covering every GET endpoint across all four collections. We use MongoDB Memory Server for isolated testing, ensuring reliable results without affecting our production database."

### Section 5: OAuth Authentication Demo (1 minute)

**What to Show:**

- **Authentication Endpoints**: Show `/auth/login` and `/auth/profile`
- **Protected Operations**: Demonstrate POST/PUT security
- **Security Coverage**: Explain which operations require authentication

**Demo Sequence:**

1. Show `/auth/login` endpoint
2. Attempt POST without authentication ‚Üí 401 error
3. Show successful POST with authentication
4. Explain security model

**Script:**
"Security is essential for production APIs. Our OAuth implementation protects all write operations. Here's our authentication system... [show /auth/login]. Watch what happens when I try to create data without authentication... [show 401]. Now with proper authentication... [show success]. All POST and PUT operations across all collections are secured."

### Section 6: API Documentation & Deployment (1.5 minutes)

**What to Show:**

- **Live Swagger Documentation**: Navigate to deployed `/api-docs`
- **Professional Documentation**: Show comprehensive endpoint docs
- **Production Deployment**: Demonstrate live API on Render
- **Complete API Coverage**: All 4 collections documented

**Deployment URL:**

```

API Documentation: https://music-api-cse341-u669.onrender.com/api-docs
```

**Script:**
"Professional APIs need comprehensive documentation and reliable deployment. Here's our live Swagger documentation at the required /api-docs route... [open browser to deployed docs]. You can see complete documentation for all four collections with examples and schema definitions. The API is fully deployed on Render and accessible for production use."
